# node.js-express-portfolio
 Portfolio website using static node.js and express

In this project I created a portfolio of side projects using node.js, Express, and Pug. Several Pug files were included with this project, although I modified all of them to fulfill the requirements of the project, and I created `page-not-found.pug` and `error.pug` pages for user friendly error display. 

I began the project by installing Express and Pug via node.js. I then created a `data.json` file where I included all of the information about the projects that I am displaying in this portfolio. All of my side projects are on live sites using GitHub pages. I took screenshots of all of the projects and reduced the file size with `squoosh.app` before uploading to my project. 

In my `app.js` file I wrote all of the functionality to run the Express app and handle errors from scratch. I also modified the `styles.css` file to use different colors from the colors provided in the original project files. I got my current color scheme from https://coolors.co/. I also added an extra image and a gif for the error pages in order to provide some fun in the user experience.
