    h1 Portfolio of Side Projects

    //- Replace with a description for your portfolio, what this project is, it's purpose, what it's supposed to accomplish, etc. 
    p This is a portfolio of projects I have completed in order to challenge myself and grow in my knowledge of web development. Over the past year I have been learning to become a web developer through Treehouse's Front End Web Development Techdegree and now its Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. When I'm not working on the coursework and projects for those programs I like to work on side projects.
